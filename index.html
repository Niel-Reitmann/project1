    <div class="explain">

      <p>The stock market opened on the 8th of March 1817 in Wall Street, New York, United States of America.
      <br />It allows individuals to buy and sell portions of publicly traded companies.
      <br />This period of time marked the beginning of America's current economic structure.
      <br />Since then, there has been numerous economic downturns and depressions.</p>

    <div class="explain2">

      <p>The concept behind how the stock market works is relativly simple.
      <br />Operating much like an auction house, the stock market enables buyers and sellers to negotiate prices and make trades.
      <br /> Investors can then buy and sell these stocks among themselves, and the exchange tracks the supply and demand of each listed stock.
      <br />When stocks appreciate in value and are worth more than the investor paid to buy the stock, that's a positive outcome for investors.</p>
